1. a member, or a guest, for lack of better term, customer

2. a head librarian, and some score of deputy librarians, which manage different sections and help out in the issuance
    and payment in case of issue mishap and failure to return the issue in agreed upon time
    
3. inventory added to the stock,
     
4. inventory evicted from the stock for a number of reasons (fresh issues of a popular book added, no demand of some books, or demand at some other place, which has not enough supply of it, (can be loaned or sold))
    
5. a person as a member has to maintain a library card, (card uid, memberdetails, renewal timeline, payment service for the card allowance)
    
6. a person can be in a library for any amount of time, can get the book issued, (for now we can have the constraint that only registered members who are members of the library can get books issued)
    
7. a person can ask for a book from a librarian, (a dedicated team of librarians who handle updating and maintaining the inventory logs)

**non-function requirements:**

1. library should be able to handle high footfall
2. library should have ample light and reading spaces
3. library should have a robust issuance service
4. library should have a robust inquiry service
